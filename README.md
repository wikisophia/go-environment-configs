# Overview

This library helps applications work with configs through environment variables.
It's a more opinionated and much smaller version of
[Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper). It assumes you're following the
12 factor app recommendations for [configs](https://12factor.net/config) and
[logging](https://12factor.net/logs).

# Goals

Applications generally want to do the following:

1. Define some default config values which work in development.
2. Let apps overwrite defaults with environment variables.
3. Validate the config values.
4. Log values of any config variables _except_ for credentials.

This library's goal is to make these steps as painless as possible.

# Usage

Define structs and tag them with the names of environment variables:

```go
type struct Config {
  Main Server `environment:"MAIN"`
  Admin Server `environment:"ADMIN"`
  Password string `environment:"PASSWORD"`
}

type struct Server {
  Port int `environment:"PORT"`
}
```

Set some environment variables in your shell.

```sh
export MYAPP_MAIN_PORT=80
export MYAPP_ADMIN_PORT=81
export MYAPP_PASSWORD=boo
```

Reference them in the code like so:

```go
import (
  "github.com/wikisophia/go-environment-configs"
)

func Parse() Config {
  // Define defaults by setting the initial struct values.
  cfg := Config{
    Main: Server{
      Port: 80
    },
    Admin: Server{
      Port: 81
    }
  }

  // Overwrite the defaults with environment variables.
  // Panic with a descriptive error message if the values don't match the types.
  configs.MustLoadWithPrefix(&cfg, "MYAPP")

  // Print the config values.
  // Anything named "password" will be logged as "<redacted>"
  configs.LogWithPrefix(&cfg, "MYAPP")
}
```

The "Prefix" is intended as a namespace to help separate your app's environment
variables from others running on the same system.

This library only handles type-based valiation. The Load() functions will return errors
or panic if an environment variable has a value which can't fit into the Config struct,
but any extra validation is on the caller. For example:

```go
  cfg := Config{
    // Set defaults like above
  }

  err := configs.LoadWithPrefix(&cfg, "MYAPP")

  // Add app-specific validation errors. The library will collect these
  // alongside errors generated by LoadWithPrefix for pretty printing.
  err = configs.Ensure(err, "MYAPP_MAIN_PORT", cfg.Main.Port > 0, "must be a positive integer")
```

# Contributing

This library doesn't yet support all the struct property types...
just the ones that I've needed for projects so far.
This covers the common ones, but certainly not all of them.
Feel free to contribute support for any new types you need.
